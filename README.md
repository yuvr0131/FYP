🚀 Project Update: End-to-End Breast Cancer Detection System
🔬 Machine Learning + Deep Learning | 🧠 ResNet50 | 🌐 Flask API + React UI | 🏥 Ultrasound Image Dataset

Thrilled to share a full-stack AI project where I built a breast cancer classification system (Benign vs Malignant) using ultrasound scans of breast tissue:

✅ Model Training (Colab)

Trained on a large dataset of breast ultrasound images using Google Colab, applying both machine learning techniques and a ResNet50 deep learning model for robust feature extraction.

Used PyTorch, image preprocessing, and evaluation pipelines for accurate predictions.

✅ Backend Development

Created a Flask-based REST API to serve the model.

Enabled CORS to connect with frontend and used Render for deployment.

API accepts image input and returns real-time classification (benign/malignant).

✅ Frontend (React + Vite)

Built an intuitive React + TypeScript interface to upload images and show results.

Deployed on Netlify.

📌 Tech Stack: Python, PyTorch, Flask, React, Vite, Render, Netlify, Google Colab, REST API, ML/DL

This project strengthened my understanding of:
🔹 Model training in the cloud (Colab)
🔹 Deep Learning + Medical Imaging
🔹 Full-stack AI deployment
